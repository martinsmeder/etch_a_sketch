Live demo: https://martinsmeder.github.io/etch_a_sketch/

A browser based version of something between a sketchpad and Etch-A-Sketch.

Some things I've learned:
* How to create a grid of equally sized divs using a for loop and DOM methods
* How to implement a slider that can change the size of said grid
* Basic use of function callbacks
* How to change the color of the divs on mousedown instead of hover
* How to implement a colorpicker
